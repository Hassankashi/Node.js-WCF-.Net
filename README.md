Introduction
Nowadays having real time web applications as two way connection is necessary in all kind of fields. 
Javascript is a good solution but it just work at client side while there are some scenario which we really need to have solutions
which works at server side. For instance storing data on database or processing data at server side. There are two popular technologies one is SignalR and other Node.js.
Why we use Node.js?
First and formost is because of we need real time solution for our web application in two way client to server and server to client side, so data can be shared between both sides. Another good advantage is Node.js is cross platform and does not need to complex preperation and installation before using it. It established well for I/O and last but not least the probability of missing data is too rare.
